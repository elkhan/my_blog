The goal is to prepare for an interview. Will try to bring all of the learning resources together.
Kind of a personal library.  
Priorities are to brush up on the Web and to get good at Algos.  
The order of priorities is:

- [JS](/docs/javascript)
- [Web](/docs/javascript/web)
- [React](/docs/react)
- [Data Structures](/docs/data_structures)
- [Algorithms](/docs/algorithms)
