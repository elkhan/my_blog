## Definition

Big O is a notation used to describe the computational complexity of an algorithm.
The computational complexity of an algorithm is split into two parts: time complexity and space complexity.
The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time the algorithm needs to run relative to the input size.
The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of memory allocated by the algorithm when run relative to the input size.

### O(1)

Constant time. Ideal case - single operation regardless of a dataset size.

### O(n)

Linear growth - looping over an array, as example.

### O(log N)

Logarithmic time. Inverse of exponents

### O(n^2)

Exponential growth

### O(n!)

Factorial growth
