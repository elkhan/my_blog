_2<sup>4</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2 \* 2 = 16_

### Logarithm is figuring out what power you have to raise to get another number

### Logarithms are another way of thinking about exponents

For example, we know that 2 raised to the 4<sup>th</sup> power equals 16. This is expressed
by the exponential equation 2<sup>4</sup> = 16.
Now, suppose someone asked us, "2 raised to which power equals 16?" The answer would be 4.
This is expressed by the logarithmic equation log<sub>2</sub>(16) = 4

_2<sup>4</sup> = 16_ <u>is equal to</u> _log<sub>2</sub>(16) = 4_

_log<sub>2</sub>(16) = x_ -> what power do I need to raise 2 to get 16

Both equations describe the same relationship between the numbers 2, 4, and 16, where 2 is the base
and 4 is the exponent.
The difference is that while the exponential form isolates the power, 16, the logarithmic
form isolates the exponent, 4.

### Definition of a logarithm

### _log<sub>b</sub>(a) = c == b<sup>c</sup> = a_

- b is the base
- c is the exponent
- a is the argument

#### Examples

- <em>
    log<sub>3</sub>(81) = x_ <u>is equal _to</u> 3<sup>x</sup> = 81_ --> x =
    4{' '}
  </em>

_log<sub>3</sub>(81) = 4_

- _log<sub>6</sub>(216) = 3_ == _6<sup>3</sup> = 216_

- _log<sub>2</sub>(64) = 6_ == _2<sup>6</sup> = 64_

- _log<sub>100</sub>(1) = 0_

- _log<sub>5</sub>(5) = 2_ == _5<sup>2</sup> = 25_

^ In the context of [Big O](/docs/algorithms/big_o/), log always means log<sub>2</sub>
