### Prototype chain

[Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)

One of the JavaScript objects' internal (hidden) properties is [[Prototype]] which is a reference to a prototype object of its constructor function.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Jane'
}

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person) === Object.prototype) // true
console.log(person.__proto__ === Object.prototype) // true
```
