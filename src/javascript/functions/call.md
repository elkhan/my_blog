## Function.prototype.call()

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)

> The call() method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.

> The call() allows for a function/method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object.
 
> call() provides a new value of this to the function/method. With call(), you can write a method once and then inherit it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object.
