## Function.prototype.call()

> The _call()_ method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.

> The _call()_ allows for a function/method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object.

> _call()_ provides a new value of this to the function/method. With _call()_, you can write a method once and then inherit
> it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object.
